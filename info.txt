creating default route takes -  
a. install  react-router-dom to use routing over the react app.
b. use createBrowserRoute used to create default route it takes object consist of path and element that design for that particular route
c. once we create that route we use RouteProvider inside the Strictmode which get access via index.html and using that we call the the route we created earlier. 


use nominatim api - instead of google api which is free tier but not have lots of location bt u can also use mapbox

we use firebase to create safe doc to save our trip details created after entering info.

also we use googlesignIn for stroing info related to one who log to the system and get store in local storage
on browser console>application>localstorage where we get our user details by which email he logged in

on sign in we get token and we pass that token to function to get the user info and store it to localstorage.

then we have savetrip to save trip detaisl to firebase where we create collection on unique id(this id helps to create a dynamic page where we can show the trips info).
we calling this function after gemini give us result in json format.

for that we create pfolder like[tripid] for that .

after that we have created a page to show our trip details
for showing image of places we will use google place api - where we give name of image and it will give us reference id of that
from which we will get image and display.
